# poker-game

Hi! My name is Isabella Aquino, and this was my very first attempt on a very simple poker game. It's based on a points system, where whomever gets the most points, wins the round (and the pot!)


There are a few things that I hope I'll be fixing soon:
- The game is based on a single-round loop;
- The cards aren't classes/objects;
- There's no ranking for the higher card, so if two people have a pair, they'll be sharing the pot, even though probably one of them has a higher card pair.
- There's a single raise limit for each round, so we can't have a raise on a raise.

My bigger goal here is to create a display using the pygame package!

I'm still getting used to using classes, but I'm very excited with my studies on programming and where this might go.
